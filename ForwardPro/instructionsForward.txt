**IMPORTANT:**
   - MAKE SURE ONLY 1 INSTANCE OF FORWARD BOT IS RUNNING, OTHERWISE WEBHOOKS WILL DOUBLE SEND TO SUCCESS
   - ONLY SET FAST MODE TO TRUE FOR BIG DROPS WHERE YOU WILL HIT A TON OF PAIRS. DONT KEEP FAST MODE RUNNING FOR MORE THAN 30 MIN, OTHERWISE YOU WILL GET RATE LIMITED BY DISCORD.
   - ANY MODIFICATION YOU DO TO THE JSON FILE WILL ONLY APPLY ONCE YOU SAVE THE JSON FILE, STOP THE FORWARD BOT, THEN RESTART IT.

Suggested ACO form instructions for profile name:
    - You must include your discord username in the profile name, otherwise we will not run you because we cannot collect PAS 
    - If you want to get tagged and dmed for success, include your discord UID at the start of the profile name

I would adivse you to put these instructions in your ACO forms so your users know how to format their profile names.

To tag and dm users you have to follow this Profile Name format for all bots (For Bookie since it doesnt have a profile name but a Account name instead follow the format the same way for the account name).

- Profile Name format:
    "<discord user UID><1 white space><anything they want>"


- Profile Name Example:
    "452345235324 Artemis1"
    - with this example the user with uid "452345235324" will be tagged and dmed and "Artemis1" will appear as the profile name in the webhook

- Profile Name Example
    "452345235324"
    - This is also valid but in this case the user with uid "452345235324" will be tagged and dmed and the profile name in the webhook will also be "452345235324"

- Profile Name Example
    "ArtemisProfile1"
    - This is also a valid profile name but in this case no one will be tagged or dmed, but "ArtemisProfile1" will be used in the webhook as the profile


Note:
    When you make any changes to the json file, save it with "command S" or go file and press save. Then rerun the forward bot.
