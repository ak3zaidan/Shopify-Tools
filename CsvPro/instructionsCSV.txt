If you want to scrape only certain channels then go to the json file and only include those channels in the "ChannelToScrape" list.
You can just delete the ones you dont want and then come back to this txt file to copy and paste them back in.

Note:
After you update the "ChannelToScrape" list, save the json file then rerun the csv bot. When you make any changes to the json save it.
