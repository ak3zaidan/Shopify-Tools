Proxies
- input proxies in the proxies.txt file, this is optional but highley recommended if the item is not live and the bot has to check multiple times
- proxies should go one per line in the format: host:port:username:password
- if you do not supply proxies then the bot can eventually get rate limited by Shopify

Discord
- If you would like to send the scrapped variants to a Discord Channel then supply a webhook in the config.json file in the `DiscordWebHook` field
- The `DiscordWebHook` is optional and leaving this blank will result in the bot only printing the scrapped variants

Config
- The config.json file is also where you define what you want to scrape 
- The `BaseUrlandInput` json entry is where you do this, you can include as many string elements into this array as you want
- they should be in the format: <base url>,<input>
- they should be comma seperated
- the base url is "www.shoepalace.com" for example
- The delay in the config.json file represents the delay in milliseconds between each retry, if your not sure what to set this to, then use 3500

Input
For Sites:
    - Supreme, Palace, Denim Tears, LadyGaga
        - Input can be:
            - URL: which is just the full url of the item 
            - Keywords: must be space seperated, capitilzation does NOT matter, to remove keywords from the search then use the dash "-" at the start. For example "Jordan -Bogo"

For any other shopify site:
    - Input can be:
        - Handle: which is the handle of the url, this is the part in the item URL that comes after "products/" and is usually a lowercased string of words seperated by dashes
        - SKU: is just the normal sku of the item
        - Keywords: must be space seperated, capitilzation does NOT matter, to remove keywords from the search then use the dash "-" at the start. For example "Jordan -Bogo"

Important
**After you make any changes to config.json, then save the file before running the bot**
